Title: Lift Simulation

This project is a web-based simulation of a lift system that can handle multiple lifts(**For now only one lift works**) and floors. It allows users to input the number of floors and lifts that they want the system to manage. The simulation then generates the required number of floors and lifts.

The user can press the up or down button on each floor to signal the lift to go up or down, respectively. The system then calculates the fastest route for the lift to reach the designated floor and displays the lift's movement using CSS animations.

This project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the use of event listeners, DOM manipulation, and conditional statements in JavaScript. It also showcases the use of CSS animations and transitions for a more visually appealing interface.

To run the project, simply download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and open the HTML file in a web browser. You will need an internet connection to load the CSS and JavaScript files.
